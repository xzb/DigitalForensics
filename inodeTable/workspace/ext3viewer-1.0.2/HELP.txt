Usage: ./ext3Viewer <FILESYSTEM> OPTION ARG1 [ ARG2 ... ]

 Dumps and interprets informations about ext3 filesystems.
 (in all this help, is the ext3 filesystem. ex: /dev/hda2)

 <FILESYSTEM> is the ext3 filesystem to examinate, could be a device or
                 a image file. eg: /dev/hda2, /dev/sda3, ./image.ext3

 OPTION and ARGS are shown below :
	-stats [ <block num> <block size> ]
	                           info about the superblock and the group
	                           descriptors. if you specify a block number
	                           and a block size, it will read an alternate 
	                           superblock. see -backups

	-stat  <inode num>         show the inode structure contents
	-bpoint  <block num>       display a block as a pointer of blocks
	-printgd  <group num>      dump the group_desc structure of a group


	-tree  <inode num>         show the form of an inode block allocation
	-imap  <group_desc num>    print the inode bitmap as an array
	-bmap  <group_desc num>    print the block bitmap as an array
	-ffi                       find the first free inode thanks to the
	                           bitmap
	-ffb                       find the first free block


	-cat  <inode num>  [ -x ]  dump the contents of a file.(read all the
	                           blocks). -x for hexa.
	-bcat  <block num> [ -x ]  dump the contents of a block.(read just one
	                           block) -x for hexa.


	-ls  <inode num>           print the directory entries of an inode.
	                           the root has inode number 2.

	-find  <inode_dir starting number> <regex pattern>
	                           find files recursively from a given directory
	                           that matches a regex pattern. for / type 2

	-iname  <inode num>        find all the files that have the given inode

	-backups                   calculate where the copies of the
	                           superblock are


	-jbd                       dump the journal contents.


	-help                      display this help. see also the man page
